Hi there, I’m a bot here to help you with your recommendation post. If you haven’t already, please review the collection of guides in the sidebar we’ve created to address the stream of recommendation posts we get here. Most notably:

* [Intro to Whiskey](https://www.reddit.com/r/whiskey/comments/5kn4q6/rwhiskeys_intro_to_whiskey/)
* [How to Evaluate and Review Whiskey](http://www.reddit.com/r/whiskey/comments/177fq5/how_to_evaluate_whiskey)

* [Scotch/Japanese/Irish Whiskies Gift Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/whiskey/comments/5eufjb/scotchjapaneseirish_whiskey_gift_recommendations/)

&nbsp;

Please try to be as specific and detailed as possible with your request. Tell us:

* your budget
* which whiskies you or your giftee have enjoyed
* which bottles you’re considering now
* where you live (pricing and availability can vary dramatically by region)
* if your shop has a limited selection or you might have trouble shipping bottles so we don’t recommend something obscure

**General Tips**    
We generally advise novices to sample as much as possible by going to a bar, splitting bottles with friends, attending festivals/tastings or getting minis to ensure you buy bottles you enjoy. It may make more sense for you to focus on sampling rather than buy full bottles at the beginning of your journey.

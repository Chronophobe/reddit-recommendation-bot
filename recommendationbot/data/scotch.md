*Hi there, I'm a bot. You've included some things in your post that lead me to believe you're looking for a recommendation. If not, sorry for intruding. I'll try to make sure this doesn't happen again in the future.*

I've responded to your post to point you to some recommendation resources and help you get the most out of your request. If you haven't already, please review the [collection of guides](https://docs.google.com/document/d/186_ANEKW8yGvvLAcjKve6tvqqBIcMGUg9-mKU5KACZk/edit) in the sidebar that we've created to address the constant stream of recommendation posts we get here. Specifically:

* [Scotchit Gift Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/2oefhq/the_2014_scotchit_holiday_shopping_guide/)
* [Recommendations for Beginners](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PX70tHEc5v-Te8FiCLmRfmHel6Er5YZP_TnYKAdTAVo/edit)
* [Next Level Malt Recommendations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZPGmllteXF99KcQgjcNwgdY7_DCEQ8Cdil1IJklKoUE/edit#heading=h.i23il3ual5dx)
* [Whisky Review Archive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X1HTxkI6SqsdpNSkSSivMzpxNT-oeTbjFFDdEkXD30o/edit#gid=695409533&fvid=484110565)
* [Malt Map](http://scotchgit.bitbucket.org/)

The malt map can be an especially valuable reference for exploring different flavor zones or for identifying scotches similar to a particular bottle you have in mind.

&nbsp;

If you've still got questions after reading the guides, please try to be as specific and detailed as possible with your request in order to get the most personalized and relevant responses.

* Tell us which bottles you or your giftee have liked 
* Tell us which bottles you're considering now
* Tell us where you live because pricing and availability can vary dramatically by region. 
* Let us know if your shop has a limited selection of whiskies so we don't recommend something that you might have a lot of trouble finding
* Provide a price range that you're comfortable spending on a bottle.

**A Few More Notes**    
As far as exploring new scotches, we generally advise novices to sample as much as possible by going to a bar, splitting bottles with friends, attending festivals/tastings or getting minis to ensure you buy bottles you enjoy. Most people need to try 20-25 scotches to understand their preferences and tastes. It may make more sense for you to buy smaller portions of different whiskies rather than full bottles.

You're going to get the most flavor/aroma drinking it neat in a tulip-shaped glass like a Glencairn but most new drinkers prefer to water down their whisky a bit. If you do end up adding water, I'd recommend adding just enough to make it tolerable and take small sips. But really there's no right or wrong way to drink so as long as you're enjoying it, you're doing it right.

Searching /r/scotch may yield some additional insights as well. Cheers!

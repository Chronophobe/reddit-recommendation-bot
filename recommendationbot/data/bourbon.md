**A Few More General Tips**    
As far as exploring new bourbons and ryes, we generally advise novices to sample as much as possible by going to a bar, splitting bottles with friends, attending festivals/tastings or getting minis to ensure you buy bottles you enjoy. Most people need to try 15-20 bourbons and ryes to understand their preferences and tastes. It may make more sense for you to buy smaller portions of different whiskies rather than full bottles.

You're going to get the most flavor/aroma drinking it neat in a tulip-shaped glass like a Glencairn but most new drinkers prefer to water down their whisky a bit. If you do end up adding water, I'd recommend adding just enough to make it tolerable and take small sips. But really there's no right or wrong way to drink so as long as you're enjoying it, you're doing it right.

Searching /r/bourbon may yield some additional insights as well. Thanks for reading, cheers!
